##### Technical advantages of Sealchain compared to Cardano:

1.	Extended UTXO model supports native multi-token

     In addition to the platform coin, the SEAL main chain also has built-in stabelcoin. The platform coin is used to pay transaction fees and incentive policies. The stablecoin is used in various financial scenarios. The platform dynamically issues or destroys stablecoins according to market conditions.

2.	Smart contract focused on security

     •	Functional, non-turing complete contract language design focused on security with succinct syntax and formal verification support.

     •	Expressive, user-friendly syntax.

     •	Deployed as public source code, and supports upgraded contracts.

     •	Atomic execution transactions.

     •	Supports single and multi-signature authentication.

     •	Directly support the current database system (SQL or NoSQL).
