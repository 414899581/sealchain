## Putting Wall Street on the Chain

Created by elite Wall Street team, Sealchain is the world’s first financial public chain with built-in Stablecoin. Sealchain focuses on financial asset transaction by using **Blockchain + AI technology**, and aims to build the next generation financial ecosystem – **Machine Finance**.

If Zcash is considered as a privacy focused version of Bitcoin, then Sealchain could be considered as a financial focused version of Cardano.
